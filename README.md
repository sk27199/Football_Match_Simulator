# Football_Match_Simulator
A python program that simulates a football match including extra time, penalties and replaying the match

This is the code I made using Python after learning for one week to show scores of two teams in 90 minutes, Extra time and Penalty shootout. I had a big problem I had to solve in this code as whenever one team won in normal time, the input would still continue to ask for the extra time score of both teams and this was also the same if one team won in extra time as the input would ask for the number of penalties scored so this issue took me little time to figure out. I then finally found out that the structure of my code was the issue as I didnâ€™t indent which lead to all three outcomes happening regardless of if one score was higher than the other in 90 minutes or Extra time so I then started moving the Extra time and Penalty shootout code to the right by 1 indent which is 4 spaces as this allows for that code to happen only if it's true for example with my code being indented now if one team won in 90 minutes then the code would stop and that team would be declared victorious, the same thing will also happen in Extra time as well as Penalty Shootout. I have also added a loop function which will allow the user to the choice to play the match again or end the match there.
