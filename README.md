# ⚽ Football Match Simulator

A Python program that simulates a football match between two teams — including **extra time** and **penalty shootouts** if needed.  
This was my first project built entirely by myself after one week of learning Python.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Takes user input for team names and goals  
- Handles match outcomes: **win, lose, or draw**  
- Goes into **extra time** if scores are level  
- Includes a **penalty shootout** if still tied after extra time  
- Lets the user **play another match** in a loop  
- Prints all results with simple, readable messages  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Using **if, elif, and else** statements  
- Creating **loops** with `while True`  
- Using **variables** to store and update scores  
- Handling **user input** and printing results  
- Building a complete program with a logical flow  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Standard library (no extra modules needed)

---

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open the project in your code editor (like VS Code or IDLE)  
3. Run the file in your terminal or Python shell:
   ```bash
   python football_match_simulator.py

Below is a example of how the code would run:

   ⚽ Welcome to the Football Match Simulator ⚽
-----------------------------------------------
Enter the first teams name: MANCHESTER UNITED
Enter the second teams name: CHELSEA
Enter MANCHESTER UNITED score: 2
Enter CHELSEA score: 2
Draw, We head into Extra Time 😱
Extra time goals by MANCHESTER UNITED: 1
Extra time goals by CHELSEA: 1
The scores are still level as we end Extra Time, We will need Penalties 😮
Number of penalties scored by MANCHESTER UNITED: 4
Number of penalties scored by CHELSEA: 5
CHELSEA wins the Penalty Shootout 🎉🎉🎉
Do you want to play another match? (yes/no): no
Thanks for playing! ⚽ Goodbye!
