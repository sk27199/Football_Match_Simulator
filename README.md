# ‚öΩ Football Match Simulator

A Python program that simulates a football match between two teams ‚Äî including **extra time** and **penalty shootouts** if needed.  
This was my first project built entirely by myself after one week of learning Python.

- Creating **loops** with `while True`  
- Using **variables** to store and update scores  
- Handling **user input** and printing results  
- Building a complete program with a logical flow
